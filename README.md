Helios One Synth V1. Arduino MIDI controlled synth.

This is for a tutorial series of how to build a MIDI controlled synthesizer.  We'll be using the Mozzi Library and the MIDI library.  You'll need those installed in your Arduino IDE before the code will run.  In this version (V1) the code lets you control the synth via MIDI and also switch between waveforms (SQR & SAW) using a switch.
